# Fortress
The most handy, open-source Discord bot.


# ðŸ›‘ Disclamer:
The repository will say "Updated 6 hours ago" or something along those lines; we have a beta branch that we use to push **DAILY** updates instead weekly/tested updates.
To view our beta branch in this repository; click [here](https://github.com/FortressBot/fortress/tree/beta) or use the following commands:


````git clone -b beta https://github.com/fortressbot/fortress````
### then use

``npm i`` or ``npm install`` & run ``npm run nodemon`` or ``npm run start``

### Remember to ____ before you run the bot:

- Rename "config.example.json" to "config.json". This is so Fortress can actually recognise it.

- Fill in config.json with all of your info, including bot token, mongo URI (only if mongo is enabled), and guild ID. (NOTE: Mongo URI is only required IF the property "mongoEnabled" is set to true.)

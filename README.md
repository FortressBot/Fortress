# Fortress
üè∞ The most handy, open-sourced Discord bot.

¬†Basic instructions for setup!
- 1. Rename "config.example.json" to "config.json". This is so Fortress can actually recognise it.
- 2. Fill in config.json with all of your info, including bot token, mongo URI (only if mongo is enabled), and guild ID.
**(NOTE: Mongo URI is only required IF the property "mongoEnabled" is set to true.)**

- 3. Run "npm run nodemon" in the console. Report any bugs using the [GitHub issues page](https://github.com/fortressbot/fortress/issues) if there happen to be any!
